This repository contains the source code for the website [Operating System in 1,000 Lines](https://1000os.seiya.me/), and a reference implementation.

## More interesting implementations

The book only covers the basics of an operating system. You can do more with the knowledge you have gained. Here are some ideas:

| Implementation | Author |
| --- | --- |
| [Shutdown command](https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines/pull/59/files) | [@calvera](https://github.com/calvera) |
| [Creating files, and reading/writing files at arbitrary names](https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines/pull/110) | [@CagriAtalar](https://github.com/CagriAtalar) |

Let me know if you have implemented something interesting!
